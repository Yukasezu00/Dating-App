# Dating App - JavaScript Basics Project

This is a simple Dating App built with JavaScript, created as an assignment for Winc Academy.  
The app asks the user for profile information such as age, gender, location, and preferences.  
It then searches for matches in a mock dataset based on the entered preferences.

## Features

- Validation of user input (names, age, gender, location, etc.)
- Matching profiles based on age, gender, location, and preferences
- Case-insensitive input (both uppercase and lowercase accepted)
- Clear display of found matches in the console

## How to use

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure Node.js is installed (version 14 or higher recommended).
3. Install dependencies in the terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the app with:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

5. Follow the prompts in the terminal and view the found matches.

## Structure

- **index.js** - main application with user interface and matching logic  
- **mockData.js** - mock dataset with example profiles

## Future improvements

- Add more profile information (hobbies, bio, etc.)  
- Graphical user interface with HTML/CSS  
- Save and load user profiles  
- More advanced matching algorithms
